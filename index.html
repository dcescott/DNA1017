		<div>Good Morning TTI,

Since my last communication I've visited with our great teams in Boston, Maryland and 
San Diego – thanks again for the warm welcome and your insightful input, I enjoyed it!

Today I have a very important topic I want you to hear from me on – let your support teams at corporate hear from you. Participate in the 2017 Employee Engagement Survey – sent to you by Inquisium (using Cvent). If you didn't receive it, have lost it, etc., contact Gretchen Evans (HR) right away – the survey ends Monday, OCT 9.

Why do I find this so important to dedicate a communication to? TTI achieved greatness by putting people first; our customers and suppliers tell us what their changing needs are every day. To remain relevant in this changing of times in distribution we must have your input too. Last month I told you that I'm a believer in studying the success of others, here are a few points of research related to the value
of employee feedback that I subscribe to:














Here's the rub, please take 10 minutes and complete the engagement survey – it's anonymous and it's your responsibility as an employee of this company to help
keep it great!

And, hey, connect with me on LinkedIn. I've received around 20 requests and want  more – it helps me get to know everyone a little faster. Send me an invite to connect. 

In my travels I'm getting a lot of great input. From success stories to territory management ideas, to how to be effective as a Family of Companies. You will hear from me on these topics – for now – go take the survey ☺ 

Look forward to your engagement,

•    Employee feedback produces valuable actionable data that can be
     implemented for organizational growth.
•    Knowing how the company measures on areas such as employee satisfaction,
     management/leadership effectiveness and working environment results in
     tangible objectives for change.
•    Assessing engagement helps to identify areas of best practice within
     the organization.
•    We can develop a company-wide engagement plan or focus directly on action
     areas for each section in our business. After we've identified the changes to
     apply, we can set priorities, determine resources and create an
     implementation schedule.
